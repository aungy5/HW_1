# HW_1

Description:

In this assignement we refactored existing code to ensure that the codebase follows accessibility standards. I started by eliminating as many <div> tags as I could. Renaming them with different semantic tags such as section, article, header, etc. After editing the html I consolidated the CSS into some general classes for different types of content on the site.
